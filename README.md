# Sound-and-Image-Processing-Portfolio
Hey, and welcome to my Portfolio for the course Computational Practices: Sound and Image Processing at the Creative Computing Institute London.

We were asked to create 5 small P5-Sketches. Enjoy.

# Interactive SinWave: 
I played around with patterns and dots and wanted to create an animation you could find on Instagram or Tumblr.
I wanted it to be minimalistic but also interactive. Because of that I added the mouse function, so that the user could easily interact with this animation.

# Covid-19 Data Visualisation: 
Because of the current situation I wanted to use the topic Covid-19 for one of my sketches. I've wanted to create an interesting data visualisation. I started to play around with API's and found one which would fit perfectly for my idea. I've created a particle system and decieded to use bright and clear colors to display the needed information.

# Audioreactive WEBGL: 
Because of my excitment to music and audio reactive visuals, I've decieded to create it on my own. at first I started off in 2D but I wasnt satisfied with the outcome. So I played around with WEBGL and nested for loops to create this audio reactive piece. 
(Warning: it might be a bit loud)

# Breathing shapes: 
I wanted to create a sketch where it looks like the shapes are having an own breathing ecosystem. 
By clicking the mouse you can generate a new piece of art!

# Hypnosis: 
Playing around with patterns and colors, I've came to this sketch. The user is able to generate a new pattern by clicking the mouse.
