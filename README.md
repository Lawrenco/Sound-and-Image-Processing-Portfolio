# Sound-and-Image-Processing-Portfolio
Hey, and welcome to my Portfolio for the course Computational Practices: Sound and Image Processing at the Creative Computing Institute.
We were asked to create five small P5-Sketches. Enjoy.

# Interactive SinWave: 
I have played around with patterns and dots and wanted to create an animation you would typically find on Instagram or Tumblr.
I wanted it to be minimalistic but also interactive. Because of that, I added the mouse function so that the user could easily interact with this animation.

# Covid-19 Data Visualization: 
Because of the current situation, I wanted to use the topic Covid-19 for one of my sketches. Instead of creating a boring infographic I wanted to create an exciting data visualization. I have started to play around with API's and found one which would fit perfectly for my idea. The output of this sketch was a particle system with the use of bright and clear colours to display the needed information.

# Audioreactive WEBGL: 
Because of my excitement to music and audio-reactive visuals, I have decided to create it on my own. At first, I started creating in 2D, but I was not satisfied with the outcome. So I played around with WEBGL and nested for loops to create this audio-reactive piece. 
(Warning: it might be a bit loud)

# Breathing shapes: 
I wanted to create a sketch where it looks like the shapes are breathing. 
By clicking the mouse, you can generate a new piece of art!

# Hypnosis: 
Playing around with patterns and colours, I have come to this sketch. The user can generate a new pattern by clicking the mouse.
(Warning: This sketch might hypnotize you)
